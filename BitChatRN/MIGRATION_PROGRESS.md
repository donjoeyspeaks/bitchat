### üîß Technical Decisions

#### 1. Architecture Choices
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex state, React Context for simple state
- **Navigation**: React Navigation 6 for mature cross-platform navigation
- **UI Framework**: React Native Paper for Material Design consistency
- **Storage**: React Native Keychain for sensitive data, AsyncStorage for app data

#### 2. Library Selections
- **Bluetooth**: `react-native-ble-plx` - most mature cross-platform BLE library
- **Cryptography**: `noble-curves` + Web Crypto API for maximum compatibility
- **BSV**: Official `bsv` library + `@scrypt-inc/scryptlib` for smart contracts
- **AI**: TensorFlow.js for broad model support, ONNX Runtime as alternative

#### 3. Performance Considerations
- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting for AI models and optional features
- **Memory Usage**: Lazy loading and cleanup for mesh network data
- **Battery Life**: Adaptive scanning and connection management
- **Network Efficiency**: Message compression and intelligent relay

### üêõ Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Mock Implementations**: Most services are currently mock implementations
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: Some libraries may have React Native version conflicts
3. **Platform Differences**: BLE behavior varies between iOS and Android
4. **AI Model Size**: Large models may impact app store distribution
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: BLE mesh may have regional restrictions

### üìö Documentation

- **README_REACT_NATIVE.md**: Comprehensive user and developer documentation
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Need to be created for new React Native structure
- **API Documentation**: Service interfaces and protocol specifications
- **Deployment Guides**: iOS App Store and Google Play Store procedures

### üéØ Success Metrics

1. **Functionality Parity**: All original BitChat features working on both platforms
2. **Performance**: 
   - App startup < 3 seconds
   - BLE discovery < 10 seconds
   - Message delivery < 5 seconds in mesh
   - AI response < 10 seconds locally
3. **User Experience**:
   - Intuitive cross-platform UI
   - Accessible design for screen readers
   - Smooth animations and interactions
4. **Technical**:
   - 95%+ test coverage
   - Memory usage < 200MB during normal operation
   - Battery life impact < 5% per hour of active use

This migration represents a significant enhancement to the original BitChat, adding Bitcoin SV integration and AI capabilities while maintaining the core decentralized mesh networking that makes it unique.
